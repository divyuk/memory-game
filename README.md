# Magic Card Game

A magic card game built on Reactjs

## Points to remember

We have const cardArray to point to the images.
The sort method uses the comparator function to determine the order of elements.
For each pair of elements being compared, the comparator returns a positive, negative, or zero value:
Negative value: The first element comes before the second.
Positive value: The first element comes after the second.
Zero: The order of the elements remains unchanged.
